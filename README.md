# WY-Scioly-Robot-Arm-2017
This is the code for the robot arm used by the Whitney Young Science Olympiad Team in 2017, built by Vivian Auduong and Lauren Delgado. We used an arduino servo HAT and servo motors to control the robot arm in the penny challenge.


The arduino servo HAT was coded with arduino and Processing code to process computer keyboard input and move the servos.
